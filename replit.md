- June 17, 2025. Fixed recurring HTML vs JSON API response issue and implemented Split PDF & Text interface - Resolved frontend routing problem by adding proper Accept headers and error handling in queryClient.ts getQueryFn. Created comprehensive SplitDocuments.tsx page displaying 4 individual forms split from multi-page LC document with authentic Azure SQL data. Added "Split PDF & Text" and "Grouped Documents" navigation tabs to "I am tired" sidebar section. Interface shows LC Application (95% confidence), Commercial Invoice (92% confidence), Bill of Lading (89% confidence), and Certificate of Origin (91% confidence) with view/download functionality for both PDF and TXT formats. API endpoint /api/forms/split-documents now properly returns JSON data instead of HTML responses.
