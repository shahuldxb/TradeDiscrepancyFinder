I need a Forms Recogniser app. Back-end code should be in python. I am using 
azure and you alredky know how to connect. All Business logic should be in 
python, UI UX only on react, you can use Node JS.  Create a new Menu “ I am 
tired” and create all these functionality under this. I am attaching a sample file 
to start with.


The muti part scanned pdf file may contain one form to x forms. (In 
sample, it consists 10 forms and may be duplicated).
2. You should segregate it to convert by individual PDF’s and text file. (This 
process is forms classification using Azure document Intelligence. This is 
the most critical part)
3. If a new form is detected, create a new json file for future use.
4. Extract the form and store it in an azure database.
5. Give me a file upload screen with progress bar.
6. Do the OCR and me an OCR progress bar.
7. Break it into constituent pdfs and show me display in a screen as files are
getting spilt and a progress bar.
8. Translate into a formatted text show me and display in a screen as files 
are getting spilt and a progress bar.
9. Extract the text and store it in a json file and display in a screen as files 
are getting spilt and a progress bar.
****************  Persistence layer **************************************
1. All the tables should be created in azure.  (No NO NO NO postgres at any
pinty and post gres is not a fail safe format)
2. Create a Table for each ingestion as a TF_ingestion
3. Create another table  as TF_ingestion_Pdf for each pdf
4. Create another table  as TF_ingestion_TXT for each TXT
5. Create another table to store all the as a TF_ingestion_fields for each 
extraction of fields
6. Any new instance of forms should wait for an approval status in Back 
office
7. For each form, create a new Table TF_forms, TF_Fields. (This will be your
base line)
****************   Part of UI UX**************************************
1. File upload and OCR recognition. One main UI
2. All actions should have a progress bar, logs (Info, Error, Warning, 
Critical)
3. Display each extracted pdf in the same windows in new tabs
4. Display each translated text in the same windows in new tabs
5. Under each, text in a sub window, perform a fields or attribute extraction 
with key value pairs
8. Give me a window to see load TF_ingestion, TF_ingestion_Pdf, 
TF_ingestion_TXT, TF_ingestion_fields. (Full beautiful Crud)
9. Give me a window to see load TF_forms and approve it. Show the 
tf_fields. Give an option to add or edit. Tf_forms and TF_fields column 
should be exhaustive. Use your AI to expand it.
