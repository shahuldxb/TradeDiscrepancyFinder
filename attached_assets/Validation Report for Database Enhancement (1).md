## ALTER TABLE Commands Validation

### Syntax Validation
- All SQL commands follow proper T-SQL syntax for SQL Server
- Commands include proper schema references with [dbo] prefix
- All data types are correctly specified with appropriate lengths
- Default values are properly formatted and appropriate for data types

### Completeness Validation
- All three main tables (custom_agents, custom_tasks, custom_crews) have complete ALTER TABLE commands
- Critical fields identified in classification have appropriate constraints
- Medium importance fields have reasonable defaults where applicable
- Performance optimization through indexes is included for all tables
- Error handling considerations are incorporated in the schema design

## UI/UX and Integration Prompts Validation

### Focus Validation
- All prompts focus exclusively on UI/UX design and integration aspects
