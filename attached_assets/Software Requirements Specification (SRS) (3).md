## 2. Functional Specifications (FS)

### 2.1 System Features

#### 2.1.1 Message Validation
The system shall provide comprehensive validation of SWIFT MT7xx messages against the 2019 Category 7 standards. This includes:

The validation engine will parse incoming MT7xx messages by field identifiers and validate them against the SWIFT standards. It will check for the presence of mandatory fields, correct field formatting, proper sequencing, and adherence to network validated rules. The system will generate detailed validation reports highlighting any discrepancies or errors found in the message structure, content, or format.

For example, when validating an MT700 (Issue of a Documentary Credit) message, the system will verify that mandatory fields such as :27: (Sequence of Total), :40A: (Form of Documentary Credit), and :31D: (Date and Place of Expiry) are present and correctly formatted. It will also check conditional dependencies, such as ensuring that if field :40A: contains "IRREVOCABLE", then field :42C: is properly included as required by the standards.

The validation process will be comprehensive, covering all aspects of the message structure including:
- Field presence validation (mandatory, optional, conditional)
- Field format validation (character types, length restrictions)
- Field content validation (allowed values, numeric ranges)
- Cross-field validation (interdependencies between fields)
- Sequence validation (correct ordering of fields)

#### 2.1.2 Message Construction
The system shall enable users to construct valid MT7xx messages through an intuitive interface. This includes:

The message composer will provide a structured form-based interface for users to input field values for specific MT7xx message types. As users input data, the system will dynamically validate entries against field-specific rules and provide immediate feedback on any formatting or content issues. The system will automatically enforce mandatory field requirements and suggest appropriate values for optional fields based on common usage patterns.

The message construction process will guide users through the complex interdependencies between fields, ensuring that conditional fields are properly included or excluded based on the values of related fields. For example, when constructing an MT707 (Amendment to a Documentary Credit), the system will ensure that the reference to the original documentary credit is properly included and that amendment details are formatted according to SWIFT standards.

Upon completion, the system will generate a properly formatted MT7xx message ready for transmission through SWIFT networks. The constructed message will be available for export in various formats including plain text, structured JSON, and ISO20022 equivalent (where applicable).

#### 2.1.3 Field Dependency Management
The system shall visualize and enforce field dependencies within and across MT7xx messages. This includes:

The field dependency graph will provide a visual representation of how fields within a message are interconnected and how different message types relate to each other in a transaction flow. For example, it will show how an MT707 (Amendment) relates to an original MT700 (Issue of a Documentary Credit) and potentially to subsequent messages like an MT754 (Advice of Payment/Acceptance/Negotiation).

The system will maintain a comprehensive database of field dependencies derived from the SWIFT standards, including:
- Intra-message dependencies (fields within the same message)
- Inter-message dependencies (fields across different message types)
- Conditional requirements based on field values
- Business practice recommendations beyond strict SWIFT requirements

This dependency management will ensure that users understand the implications of changes to one field on other fields or messages, reducing errors and improving the quality of SWIFT message processing.

#### 2.1.4 Message Type Support
The system shall support all MT7xx message types as defined in the 2019 Category 7 standards, including but not limited to:

## 5. Business Rules for Message Fields

### 5.1 Business Rules Engine Overview

#### 5.1.1 Purpose and Scope
The Business Rules Engine is a critical component of the SWIFT MT7xx Message Automation System that enforces the complex business logic governing SWIFT message fields. This engine ensures that messages not only conform to the syntactic requirements of the SWIFT standards but also adhere to semantic rules and business practices specific to documentary credits and guarantees.

The Business Rules Engine serves as the central repository for all validation and business logic, providing a consistent and maintainable approach to rule enforcement. By separating business rules from application code, the system enables business analysts and domain experts to manage rules without requiring developer intervention, improving agility and reducing maintenance costs.

The engine encompasses rules for field validation, inter-field dependencies, cross-message validation, and business practice recommendations. It supports both deterministic rules (with clear yes/no outcomes) and probabilistic rules (with confidence scores for potential issues), allowing for different levels of validation stringency based on user preferences and use cases.

#### 5.1.2 Rule Categories
The Business Rules Engine implements several categories of rules:

1. **Field Format Rules**: Ensure that field content adheres to the specified format (e.g., character types, length restrictions)
2. **Field Content Rules**: Validate the semantic correctness of field values (e.g., valid currency codes, date formats)
3. **Mandatory Field Rules**: Enforce the presence of required fields based on message type and context
4. **Conditional Field Rules**: Manage the complex dependencies between fields within a message
5. **Cross-Field Validation Rules**: Ensure consistency between related fields (e.g., amounts, dates, references)
6. **Cross-Message Rules**: Validate relationships between different message types in a transaction flow
7. **Business Practice Rules**: Implement recommended practices beyond strict SWIFT requirements

Each rule category serves a specific purpose in ensuring message validity and compliance with both technical standards and business expectations.

#### 5.1.3 Rule Implementation Approach
The Business Rules Engine employs a hybrid approach to rule implementation:

1. **Declarative Rules**: Simple validation rules expressed in a domain-specific language or configuration
2. **Procedural Rules**: Complex validation logic implemented as code functions
3. **Decision Tables**: Matrix-based rules for scenarios with multiple conditions and outcomes
4. **Rule Flows**: Sequential or branching rule execution for complex validation scenarios

This hybrid approach balances flexibility, performance, and maintainability, allowing for the most appropriate implementation method based on rule complexity and execution requirements.

### 5.2 Database-Driven Rule Management

#### 5.2.1 Rule Storage and Organization

   - ErrorMessage
   - SequenceNumber

4. **RuleScopes Table**: Defines the applicability scope of rules
   - ScopeID (PK)
   - RuleID (FK)
   - MessageTypeID (FK)
   - ApplicabilityExpression

This database structure allows for flexible rule definition, efficient rule execution, and comprehensive rule management capabilities.

#### 5.2.2 Rule Versioning and History
The system maintains a complete history of rule changes to support audit requirements and enable rollback if needed:

1. **RuleVersions Table**: Stores historical versions of rules
   - VersionID (PK)
   - RuleID (FK)
   - VersionNumber
   - RuleDefinition (JSON)
   - EffectiveFrom
   - EffectiveTo
   - ChangedBy
   - ChangeReason

2. **RuleChangeLog Table**: Records all modifications to rules
   - LogID (PK)
   - RuleID (FK)
   - ChangeType (Create, Update, Deactivate)
   - ChangedBy
   - ChangeDate
   - OldValue
   - NewValue
   - ChangeReason

This versioning approach ensures traceability and compliance with regulatory requirements while supporting business continuity through rule evolution.

#### 5.2.3 Rule Administration Interface

     ```

### 5.4 Rule Execution Framework

#### 5.4.1 Rule Execution Process
The Business Rules Engine follows a structured process for rule execution:

1. **Rule Selection**: Identify applicable rules based on message type and context
2. **Rule Sorting**: Order rules by priority and dependencies
3. **Condition Evaluation**: Evaluate rule conditions against message data
4. **Action Execution**: Perform actions for rules with satisfied conditions
5. **Result Aggregation**: Collect and categorize validation results
6. **Result Reporting**: Format and return validation results to the caller

This process ensures efficient and consistent rule execution while supporting complex validation scenarios.

#### 5.4.2 Performance Optimization
The rule execution framework implements several optimizations:

1. **Rule Indexing**: Rules are indexed by message type and field for quick lookup
2. **Condition Caching**: Frequently used condition results are cached
3. **Lazy Evaluation**: Rules are evaluated only when needed
4. **Parallel Execution**: Independent rules are executed in parallel
5. **Early Termination**: Rule execution stops when critical errors are found
6. **Result Caching**: Validation results are cached for repeated validations

These optimizations ensure that rule execution remains performant even with large rule sets and complex messages.

#### 5.4.3 Extensibility Mechanisms
The rule execution framework provides several mechanisms for extending the rule system:

1. **Custom Rule Types**: Define new rule types for specialized validation
2. **External Rule Sources**: Integrate rules from external systems or standards
3. **Rule Plugins**: Add custom rule implementations through a plugin architecture
4. **Rule Templates**: Create reusable rule patterns for common validation scenarios
5. **Rule Inheritance**: Define hierarchical relationships between rules

These extensibility mechanisms ensure that the rule system can adapt to evolving business requirements and integration needs.

### 5.5 Business Rule Examples

#### 5.5.1 Simple Validation Rule
A simple validation rule for checking the format of a reference number:

```sql
-- Rule definition
INSERT INTO Rules (RuleName, Description, RuleType, Severity)
VALUES ('ReferenceNumberFormat', 'Validates format of reference numbers', 'Format', 'Error');

-- Rule condition
INSERT INTO RuleConditions (RuleID, FieldID, OperatorType, ComparisonValue)
VALUES (@@IDENTITY, (SELECT FieldID FROM Fields WHERE FieldCode = ':20:'), 'Matches', '^[A-Za-z0-9/\-]{1,16}$');

-- Rule action
INSERT INTO RuleActions (RuleID, ActionType, ErrorMessage)
VALUES (@@IDENTITY, 'Validate', 'Reference number must be 1-16 alphanumeric characters, slashes, or hyphens');
```

This rule ensures that reference numbers follow the required format, providing clear error messages when violations are detected.

#### 5.5.2 Conditional Field Rule
A conditional rule that requires field :42C: when field :40A: contains "IRREVOCABLE TRANSFERABLE":

```sql
-- Rule definition
INSERT INTO Rules (RuleName, Description, RuleType, Severity)
VALUES ('MT700_TransferableRequires42C', 'Requires field 42C when credit is transferable', 'Dependency', 'Error');

-- Rule condition
INSERT INTO RuleConditions (RuleID, FieldID, OperatorType, ComparisonValue)
VALUES (@@IDENTITY, (SELECT FieldID FROM Fields WHERE FieldCode = ':40A:'), 'Equals', 'IRREVOCABLE TRANSFERABLE');

-- Rule action
INSERT INTO RuleActions (RuleID, ActionType, TargetFieldID, ErrorMessage)
VALUES (@@IDENTITY, 'Require', (SELECT FieldID FROM Fields WHERE FieldCode = ':42C:'), 'Field :42C: is required when credit is transferable');
```

This rule enforces the dependency between the form of documentary credit and the draft at field, ensuring that all required fields are present based on context.

#### 5.5.3 Cross-Field Validation Rule
A cross-field validation rule that ensures the expiry date is after the issue date:

```sql
-- Rule definition
INSERT INTO Rules (RuleName, Description, RuleType, Severity)
VALUES ('ExpiryAfterIssue', 'Ensures expiry date is after issue date', 'CrossField', 'Error');

-- Rule conditions
INSERT INTO RuleConditions (RuleID, FieldID, OperatorType, ComparisonValue, LogicalOperator, SequenceNumber)
VALUES (@@IDENTITY, (SELECT FieldID FROM Fields WHERE FieldCode = ':31D:'), 'Exists', 'TRUE', 'AND', 1);

INSERT INTO RuleConditions (RuleID, FieldID, OperatorType, ComparisonValue, LogicalOperator, SequenceNumber)
VALUES (@@IDENTITY, (SELECT FieldID FROM Fields WHERE FieldCode = ':31C:'), 'Exists', 'TRUE', 'AND', 2);

-- Rule action (simplified - actual implementation would use procedural code)
INSERT INTO RuleActions (RuleID, ActionType, Parameters, ErrorMessage)
VALUES (@@IDENTITY, 'ValidateDates', '{"dateField1": ":31D:", "dateField2": ":31C:", "comparison": "greaterThan"}', 'Expiry date must be after issue date');
```

This rule ensures logical consistency between date fields, preventing invalid temporal relationships in the message.

#### 5.5.4 Complex Business Rule
A complex business rule for validating amendment consistency:

```sql
-- Rule definition
INSERT INTO Rules (RuleName, Description, RuleType, Severity)
VALUES ('AmendmentConsistency', 'Ensures amendments are consistent with original DC', 'CrossMessage', 'Error');

-- Rule conditions
INSERT INTO RuleConditions (RuleID, FieldID, OperatorType, ComparisonValue)
VALUES (@@IDENTITY, (SELECT FieldID FROM Fields WHERE FieldCode = ':21:'), 'Exists', 'TRUE');

-- Rule action (simplified - actual implementation would use procedural code)
INSERT INTO RuleActions (RuleID, ActionType, Parameters, ErrorMessage)
VALUES (@@IDENTITY, 'ValidateAmendment', '{"checkOriginal": true, "checkPreviousAmendments": true}', 'Amendment is inconsistent with original documentary credit or previous amendments');
```

This rule would be implemented primarily through procedural code that performs complex validation logic across multiple messages, ensuring the integrity of the amendment process.

### 5.6 Rule Management Lifecycle

#### 5.6.1 Rule Development Process
The development of business rules follows a structured process:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Identify business requirements and validation needs
2. **Rule Analysis**: Analyze requirements and translate them into specific rules
3. **Rule Design**: Design rule structure, conditions, and actions
4. **Rule Implementation**: Implement rules in the database or code
5. **Rule Testing**: Test rules against sample data and edge cases
6. **Rule Documentation**: Document rule purpose, behavior, and implementation
7. **Rule Deployment**: Deploy rules to the production environment

This process ensures that rules accurately reflect business requirements and are properly implemented and tested.

#### 5.6.2 Rule Governance
The management of business rules is governed by the following principles:

1. **Ownership**: Each rule has a designated business owner responsible for its accuracy
2. **Change Control**: Changes to rules follow a formal approval process
3. **Version Control**: Rule versions are tracked and managed
